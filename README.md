# Codeantiplag
Program to check the file for antiplagiarism
The Main idea:
1. Replacing the comment section(// and  /* */) and #include section using regex.
2. Separation the key words and operators in one standard for future analysis and save it on bank.
3. Rename all 'words' to special standard like id01 and delete all of them that were mentioned one time in text.
